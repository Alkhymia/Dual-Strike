Configuration Engine Readme
===========================
THIS IS A DRAFT

This configuration engine is a framework for bit-based configurations.
It is aimed at usage with AVR microcontrollers to read out, modify and update
EEPROM data.
The Java files were developed for Java 6.

Important XML files:
--------------------

-"java/dualstrike/configuration/configuration.xsd"
 XML Schema for configuration definitions.
 
-"java/dualstrike/configuration/annotated-configuration.xsd"
 XML Schema for annotated configuration definitions, adding byte and bit information.

-"java/dualstrike/configuration/annotate-configuration.xsl"
 XSLT stylesheet adding byte and bit information to configuration definitions.

-"java/dualstrike/configuration/configuration2header-file.xsl"
 XSLT stylesheet to create a C header for AVR microcontrollers from
 configuration definitions.

-"configuration-dual_strike-v1.xml"
 Configuration definition for the Dual Strike.
 
Important Java Classes:
-----------------------

All Java source files reside in the directory "java".

-"dualstrike.configuration.ConfigurationUtility"
 Class to work with configuration files utilizing the XML Schema and XSLT
 files mentioned above.
 Example usages:
 * java -cp java dualstrike.configuration.ConfigurationUtility annotate configuration-dual_strike-v1.xml annotated-configuration.xml
 * java -cp java dualstrike.configuration.ConfigurationUtility 2header-file configuration-dual_strike-v1.xml configuration.h

-"dualstrike.configuration.model.*"
 JAXB classes generated by the XJC from the annotated configuration XML Schema.

-"dualstrike.configuration.ModelUtility"
 Class to work with the model classes.

-"dualstrike.configuration.HexFilesUtility"
 Class with methods to read plain HEX files to byte arrays and to write byte
 arrays to Intel 8-bit HEX files.

Generating JAXB Model Classes
-----------------------------

If the directory this file is residing in is the current directory and the
directory of a JDK is in the environment variable "JAVA_HOME", under windows
the command to compile the model classes from the annotated configuration XML
Schema is:
"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\xjc" -d java -p dualstrike.configuration.model java\dualstrike\configuration\annotated-configuration.xsd
