This configuration engine is a framework for bit-based configurations.
It is aimed at usage with AVR microcontrollers to read out, modify and update
EEPROM data. It makes heavy use of the XML technologies XML Schema and XSL
Transformations.
The Java files were developed with Eclipse Helios for Java 6.


Important XML files:
--------------------
-"java/dualstrike/configuration/configuration-def.xsd"
 XML Schema for configuration definitions.
 
-"java/dualstrike/configuration/annotated-configuration-def.xsd"
 XML Schema for annotated configuration definitions, adding byte and bit information.

-"java/dualstrike/configuration/annotate-configuration-def.xsl"
 XSLT stylesheet adding byte and bit information to configuration definitions.

-"java/dualstrike/configuration/configuration-def2header-file.xsl"
 XSLT stylesheet to create a C header for AVR microcontrollers from
 configuration definitions.

-"configuration.xml"
 Example configuration definition for the Dual Strike.
 
 
Important Java Classes:
-----------------------
All Java source files reside in the directory "java".

-"dualstrike.configuration.Configuration"
 Main execution class.

-"dualstrike.configuration.definition.*"
 JAXB classes generated by the XJC from the annotated configuration XML Schema.

-"dualstrike.configuration.ConfigurationDefUtility"
 Class to work with configuration definition files.

-"dualstrike.configuration.HexFilesUtility"
 Class with methods to read and write plain HEX files to byte arrays and to
 write byte arrays to Intel 8-bit HEX files.

See the Javadoc for more information.


Generating JAXB Configuration Definition Classes
------------------------------------------------
If the directory this file is residing in is the current directory and the
directory of a JDK is in the environment variable "JAVA_HOME", under windows
the command to compile the model classes from the annotated configuration XML
Schema is:
"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\xjc" -d java -p dualstrike.configuration.definition java\dualstrike\configuration\annotated-configuration-def.xsd
