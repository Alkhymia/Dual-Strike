Dual Strike Configuration
=========================
You need the firmware 3.1 installed on your Dual Strike. You also need a 
Java 6 Runtime Environment (for example from Oracle: 
http://www.java.com/download/) installed on your PC. Non-Windows users 
please read "mcc/mcc_Readme.txt". It is assumed that the Java 
executables are in the path (this is the case most probably). 

On Windows start the configuration editor by double-clicking on 
"configuration_editor.bat". 

On non-Windows systems change into the directory "mcc" and execute the 
command "java -jar mcc-1.1.1.jar".
