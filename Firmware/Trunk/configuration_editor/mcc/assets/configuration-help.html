<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Dual Strike PCB is a completely solderless controller board for your arcade stick.
Every connection to buttons or directions screw in directly to the side of the
board, so installation requires nothing more than a screwdriver. The Dual Strike
works on any PC (including Mac, Windows 7/Vista/XP/2K/98, Mac OS X and Linux) as well as
Playstation 3 systems. It also has a pass-through dual mod function supporting 
USB interfaces (or similar) like Dreamcast or XBox360.</p>
<p>This makes the Dual Strike the perfect solution for customers who want to build
or dual mod an arcade stick .</p>
<h2>Configuration Mode</h2>
<p>To enter configuration mode press Select on plugging in, then the Dual Strike is
ready to be configured by a PC. To leave the
configuration mode press Start.</p>
