Dual Strike Configuration
=========================
You need the firmware 3.0 installed on your Dual Strike. You also need a Java 6
Runtime Environment (for example from Oracle: http://www.java.com/download/)
installed on your PC. Non-Windows users please read "mcc_Readme.txt".

Start the configuration editor by double-clicking on 
"configuration_editor_atmega8.bat" if you have a Dual Strike V1 (without
ATmega168 upgrade) or Dual Strike SMD, use "configuration_editor_atmega168.bat"
for Dual Strike V2 or a Dual Strike V1 upgraded with ATmega168.
To load and save the configuration to the Dual Strike you first have to enter
the configuration mode by pressing Select on plugging in. By pressing Start the
configuration mode is left.
